## Introduction

This project grew out of a desire to assemble a pedalboard for ambient guitar. It occured to me that most of the pedals that one would use for such a rig have many plugin equivalents, and that one could eliminate all of the stompboxes, power supplies and cables by creating a low-latency plugin host that would implement the same functions/fx, routing and switching.
